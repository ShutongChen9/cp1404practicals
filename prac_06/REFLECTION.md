I reviewed the previous weeks and gained a clearer and more organized understanding of the structure of the code.

I need to consolidate the knowledge that I am not familiar with before 
and take the time to preview the new knowledge.

I will record and mark the key knowledge points in class learning, 
so as to facilitate the review of knowledge points in the future.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
I need to start my work after I have mastered the knowledge, 
rather than start blindly trying and wasting a lot of time

I wish there were more examples and answers in the knowledge points to help me understand.
